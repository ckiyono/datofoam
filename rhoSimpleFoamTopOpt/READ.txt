1) Run with: rm -f volumeConstraint.txt && rm -f objectiveFunction.txt && foamListTimes -rm && simpleFoamTopOpt

2) At the controlDict, use:
- latestTime and a high value for endTime
- stopAt nextWrite

3) Files created:
- nOptTemp (temporary for material model usage...it is deleted after the solver stops)
- objectiveFunction (objective function values for all iterations)
- orthoCols (orthogonal columns for state and design variables + groups of possible non-zeros for Jacobian matrices)
- volumeConstraint (volume constraint factors to be used in the next optimization iteration)

4) If cyclicAMI is used:
- Always use z axis
- It is recommended to make half domain and use mirrorMesh

5) Never use parallel in primal solve when performing FD assessment

6) If using adaptive mesh refinement, it is a good idea to use zeroGradient at walls in rhoDes. This way, the algorithm
will not refine all walls.
